## Airdrop Checker

Sample scripts to quickly check whether you're eligible for an airdrop across a bunch of wallets

## Usage

Add your EVM/SOL/Cosmos ecosystem wallets (all chains) to `wallets.txt` file

```bash
$ npm install
$ node dym.js
```

To create an airdrop checker for a new claim, copy paste one of these files and update the claim endpoint (usually a `GET` request). Should work automagically.
